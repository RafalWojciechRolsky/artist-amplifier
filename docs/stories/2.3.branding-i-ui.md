2. Smoke 1→4 przechodzi na mobile i desktop; brak regresji Stories 1.1–1.4.

  - [ ] Apply color roles (primary, secondary, surface, etc.) to all relevant components.
- [ ] Unify components according to `front-end-spec.md#components`.
  - [ ] Update `Button` component with variants (Primary/Secondary/Ghost) and states (loading).
  - [ ] Update `Input` and `Textarea` components with new styles and error/counter display.
  - [ ] Update `FileInput` to show format/size info and "Change file" action.
  - [ ] Implement a simple `Stepper/Progress` indicator.
  - [ ] Implement `Toast` and `StatusBanner` components.
- [ ] Ensure A11y compliance from `front-end-spec.md#a11y`.
  - [ ] Add `focus-visible` states to all interactive elements.
  - [ ] Verify color contrast is >= 4.5:1.
  - [ ] Add `data-testid` attributes to all specified components for testing.
- [ ] Perform smoke tests for flows 1.1-1.4 on mobile and desktop to ensure no regressions.

## Dev Notes

### Branding & Style Guide
- The primary color palette is defined in `docs/front-end-spec.md#branding`. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#branding]
- Primary Accent: `#6A3DE8`, Hover: `#5429D0`. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#branding]
- Typography should follow the scale defined in the spec (Inter, system-ui). [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#branding]
- Spacing, radius, and shadows should be consistent with the defined tokens. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#branding]

### Component Specifications
- All components listed in the tasks must be updated to match the visual and functional requirements of `docs/front-end-spec.md#components`. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#components]
- Pay close attention to the states of each component (default, hover, focus, disabled, loading). [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#components]

### Accessibility (A11y)
- All interactive elements must have a visible focus state. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#a11y]
- Use `aria-live` for status updates and toasts. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#a11y]
- Ensure all `data-testid` hooks from `docs/front-end-spec.md#test-hooks` are implemented. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#test-hooks]

### File Locations
- Most changes will be within existing components in `src/components/`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- Global styles are defined in `src/app/globals.css`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- The main page layout is in `src/app/page.tsx`. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

## Testing

- Unit tests should be created for any new or modified components to verify their states and variants. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#108-testy-mvp]
- Manual smoke tests are required for the full 1.1-1.4 flow on both mobile and desktop viewports to check for visual regressions. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md#108-testy-mvp]
- Use `data-testid` hooks for targeting elements in tests. [Source: docs/front-end-spec.md#test-hooks]
