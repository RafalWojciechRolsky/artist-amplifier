# Story 3.2: Refactor File Upload to Use Vercel Blob

## Status

Ready for review

## Story

**As a** developer,
**I want** to refactor the file upload mechanism to use Vercel Blob,
**so that** the application can handle large audio files efficiently and securely.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  The frontend file upload component is modified to request a signed URL from the backend.
2.  A new backend endpoint is created to generate and return a Vercel Blob signed URL for uploading.
3.  The file is uploaded directly from the client to Vercel Blob using the signed URL.
4.  The backend analysis endpoint is updated to accept the Vercel Blob URL of the uploaded file instead of the file itself.
5.  The application correctly handles the entire workflow: signed URL generation, file upload, and passing the URL to the analysis endpoint.
6.  The solution is compliant with the security and architecture guidelines (no keys on the client).

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

The previous story (3.1) successfully added a "Song Title" input and integrated it into the backend. The E2E tests were also added, which can be adapted for this story.

### Data Models

- **`ArtistInput`**: This interface in `src/lib/types.ts` will be modified. The `audioFileName`, `audioMimeType`, and `audioSizeBytes` will be replaced by `audioUrl: string`. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]

### API Specifications

- **`POST /api/upload` (New)**: This new endpoint will be created to handle requests for signed URLs.
  - **Request**: `{ "filename": "song.mp3", "contentType": "audio/mpeg" }`
  - **Response**: `{ "signedUrl": "...", "url": "..." }`
- **`POST /api/audio/analyze` (Modification)**: This endpoint will be updated to accept a URL instead of a file. - **Request**: `{ "audioUrl": "..." }` - **Response**: Remains the same.
  [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]

### File Locations

- **Frontend**:
  - `src/components/AudioUpload.tsx`: Will be refactored to use the new upload flow.
  - `src/lib/api/client.ts`: A new function will be added to call the `/api/upload` endpoint. The existing `analyzeAudio` function will be updated.
- **Backend**: - `src/app/api/upload/route.ts`: New route handler for generating signed URLs. - `src/app/api/audio/analyze/route.ts`: Will be updated to fetch the file from the provided URL.
  [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]

### Technical Constraints

- Use the `@vercel/blob` npm package for blob operations.
- Ensure all sensitive keys and operations are handled on the backend.
- The client should only receive the signed URL.
  [Source: docs/architecture/3-tech-stack.md, docs/architecture/7-external-apis.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Unit tests for the new `/api/upload` endpoint.
  - Update unit tests for the `/api/audio/analyze` endpoint.
  - Update unit tests for the `AudioUpload` component.
- **E2E Tests**: - Update the E2E smoke tests to reflect the new upload mechanism.

#### Risk Assessment

| Risk Area      | Severity | Description                                                   | Mitigation                                                                                                                                                             |
| -------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Data Integrity | HIGH     | Incomplete or corrupted uploads could cause analysis failures | Server computes checksum and optionally compares with client-provided; download has retry=2. Consider making client checksum mandatory and surfacing mismatch to user. |
| Security       | MEDIUM   | API key exposure                                              | Keys are server-side only as required                                                                                                                                  |
| Error Handling | MEDIUM   | Edge cases in upload failures                                 | Good unit coverage for abort/network; add E2E coverage and user-friendly UI states                                                                                     |
| Performance    | LOW      | Large file handling                                           | Vercel Blob designed for this use case                                                                                                                                 |

#### Technical Debt

1. Client checksum is optional; mandate for production paths and display mismatch guidance
2. Error messages not fully i18n; align with `UI_TEXT`
3. Missing E2E flows for retry/polling and failure UIs
4. Story path drift (`src/lib/api/client.ts`) vs actual implementation in `src/lib/analysis.ts`

#### Recommendations

1. **Critical:** Update story and/or code to resolve path drift (either add `src/lib/api/client.ts` thin wrapper or update docs to point to `src/lib/analysis.ts`)
2. **Important:** Make client checksum mandatory when feasible; if missing, warn and require user confirmation for large files
3. **Important:** Add E2E scenarios: network abort, upload failure, checksum mismatch (422), 202 background job → polling success/timeout
4. **Nice-to-have:** Improve progress reporting during large file uploads
5. **Nice-to-have:** Document Vercel Blob configuration and key management in architecture docs

#### Test Coverage Analysis

Unit tests exist for `/api/upload` and client error paths; analysis endpoint has robust validations and retry. E2E requires expansion to cover failure paths and background processing.

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-03

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

- Robust server validation in `src/app/api/audio/analyze/route.ts`: MIME checks, size limit, light signature sniffing, download with retries, optional checksum compare, clear API errors.
- Upload token endpoint `src/app/api/upload/route.ts` correctly delegates to `handleUpload` with size/type limits.
- Thin client in `src/lib/api/client.ts` provides `uploadToBlob`, `requestAnalyze`, and status polling.
- Frontend `src/components/AudioUpload.tsx` validates file and calls `validateAudioFile`; upload/analysis orchestration happens outside this component (acceptable if handled at form level).

### Refactoring Performed

- No code changes performed during QA review.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ (functional style, TypeScript, no default exports in libs, runtime validation on server)
- Project Structure: ✓ (API routes and lib placement match `docs/architecture/source-tree.md` intent)
- Testing Strategy: ✓/✗ (good unit coverage; E2E gaps remain for unhappy paths)
- All ACs Met: ✓ (1–4 met; 5 functionally met but E2E for failure/polling scenarios pending)

### Improvements Checklist

- [ ] Make client checksum mandatory (or gated by size) and surface mismatch UI
- [ ] Add E2E scenarios: network abort, upload failure, checksum 422, 202 → polling success/timeout
- [ ] Document Vercel Blob configuration and key management in `docs/architecture/7-external-apis.md`
- [ ] Ensure i18n for new error messages aligns with `UI_TEXT`

### Security Review

- Keys remain server-side; token issuance constrained by type/size. Recommend documenting auth/authorization strategy for `onBeforeGenerateToken` before production.

### Performance Considerations

- Limits appropriate for 50MB. Background 202 + polling path supported by API; ensure UI avoids blocking and shows progress.

### Files Modified During Review

- None

5. **Missing Tests Added**: Created comprehensive unit tests for upload endpoint and error handling scenarios
6. **Test Coverage**: Added tests for network failures, checksum validation, retry mechanisms, and edge cases
