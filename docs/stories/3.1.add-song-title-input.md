# Story 3.1: Add Song Title Input

## Status

Done

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to provide a title for my song,
**so that** it can be clearly identified throughout the analysis and in the final description.

## Acceptance Criteria

1.  A new text input field labeled "Song Title" is added to the main form.
2.  The "Song Title" field is required.
3.  The entered song title is sent to the backend along with the other artist and audio information.
4.  The backend associates the song title with the analysis job.
5.  The song title is used in the prompt for generating the final description.

## Dev Notes

### API Specifications

- **Endpoint Modification**: The `POST /api/audio/generate` endpoint needs to be updated to accept the `songTitle` in its JSON payload. [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]
- **Data Flow**: The `songTitle` will be passed from the frontend to the `/api/audio/generate` endpoint. The backend will then include this title when formulating the prompt for the LLM. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture-opcjonalny-bff.md]

### Data Models

- **`ArtistInput`**: The `ArtistInput` interface in `src/lib/types.ts` should be updated to include `songTitle: string`. [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]

### File Locations

- **Frontend**:
  - `src/app/page.tsx`: Add the new input field to the main form. [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
  - `src/components/ArtistForm.tsx`: This component will likely house the new input field. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
  - `src/lib/api/generate.ts`: Update the API client to send the `songTitle`. [Source: docs/architecture/10-frontend-architecture.md]
- **Backend**:
  - `src/app/api/audio/generate/route.ts`: Update the route handler to receive the `songTitle` and pass it to the LLM service. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture-opcjonalny-bff.md]
  - `src/lib/server/llm.ts`: Update the LLM service to include the `songTitle` in the prompt. [Source: docs/architecture/11-backend-architecture-opcjonalny-bff.md]

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**:
  - Update unit tests for the `ArtistForm` component to cover the new input field and its validation.
  - Update unit tests for the `/api/audio/generate` endpoint to verify that the `songTitle` is correctly received and used.
- **E2E Tests**: Update E2E smoke tests to include filling out the new "Song Title" field. [Source: docs/architecture/coding-standards.md]

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Frontend Implementation** (AC: 1, 2, 3)

### 2. Risk Assessment

| Risk ID | Description                                                          | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation                                                                                                                             |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------: | :----: | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R-01    | Incorrect or empty `songTitle` is sent despite frontend validation.  |    Low     | Medium | Backend validation is in place, which rejects requests with an empty `songTitle`.                                                      |
| R-02    | The new field breaks the form layout on specific screen sizes.       |    Low     |  Low   | The component uses standard responsive classes. Manual testing on different viewports is recommended.                                  |
| R-03    | The `songTitle` is not correctly incorporated into the LLM prompt.   |    Low     |  High  | The code in `src/lib/server/llm.ts` clearly shows the title being added. A unit test for `buildPrompt` would fully mitigate this.      |
| R-04    | **Regression**: Changes to the form state management introduce bugs. |    Low     | Medium | The reducer logic is straightforward. The missing E2E test is the primary mitigation for catching unforeseen regressions in user flow. |

### 3. Test Design

**Unit Tests:**

- **`validateArtistForm`**:
  - `it('should return an error if songTitle is empty or just whitespace')`
  - `it('should not return an error if songTitle is valid')`
- **`buildPrompt` (`src/lib/server/llm.ts`)**:
  - `it('should correctly include the songTitle in the user prompt')`
- **`/api/audio/generate` route**:
  - `it('should return a 400 error if songTitle is missing from the payload')`

**Integration Tests:**

- Test the flow from `ArtistForm` submission to the `fetch` call in `generateDescription`, ensuring the `songTitle` is correctly passed through the layers.

**E2E Tests:**

- **Scenario**: User provides a song title and generates a description.
  - **Given** I am on the main page.
  - **When** I fill in the "Artist Name" and "Artist Description".
  - **And** I fill in the "Song Title" with "Cosmic Echoes".
  - **And** I upload a valid audio file and wait for analysis.
  - **And** I click the "Generate Description" button.
  - **Then** the generated description should be visible.
  - **And** the final prompt sent to the LLM (if verifiable via logs/mocks) should contain "Song title: Cosmic Echoes".

### 4. Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Assessment

- **Security**: The backend performs basic validation on the `songTitle` (trimming, checking for presence, length limit). This is sufficient to mitigate basic injection risks for its current use case (inclusion in an LLM prompt). No further vulnerabilities are introduced.
- **Performance**: The addition of a single text field has a negligible impact on frontend rendering performance and backend processing time.

### 5. QA Gate Decision

- **Decision**: `PASS`
- **Reason**: The implementation is solid and meets all acceptance criteria. The previously missing E2E test has been implemented and is passing, resolving the initial concern.
- **Recommendation**: The story is ready for deployment.
