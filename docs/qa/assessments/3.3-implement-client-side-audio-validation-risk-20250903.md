# Risk Profile: Story 3.3 - Implement Client-Side Audio Validation

Date: 2025-09-03
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

The risk profile for this story is **LOW**. The feature is a client-side user experience enhancement and does not introduce significant security or data integrity risks, provided that existing server-side validation is maintained. The primary risks are technical, related to the accuracy of audio metadata parsing in the browser, and the potential for business logic to diverge between the client and server.

- **Total Risks Identified**: 4
- **Critical Risks**: 0
- **High Risks**: 0
- **Overall Risk Score**: 86/100 (Low Risk)

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                      | Category  | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| TECH-001 | Inaccurate Duration Calculation  | Technical | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | Mismatch with Server-Side Rules  | Business  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| SEC-001  | Bypassing Client-Side Validation | Security  | High (3)    | Low (1)    | 3     | Low      |
| TECH-002 | UI Blocking                      | Technical | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

### 1. TECH-001: Inaccurate Duration Calculation (Score: 4 - Medium)

- **Description**: The client-side JavaScript code to determine audio duration might be inaccurate across different browsers or for certain audio codecs/formats (e.g., VBR MP3s).
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test the duration calculation logic across major browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
  - Add logging to capture cases where client-side and server-side validation differ.
- **Testing Focus**: E2E tests using various audio file types (CBR, VBR, different formats like MP3, WAV, FLAC).

### 2. BUS-001: Mismatch with Server-Side Rules (Score: 4 - Medium)

- **Description**: The client-side validation rules (50MB, 10 mins) could become out of sync with the actual server-side rules.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Create a shared constants file (e.g., in `src/lib/constants.ts`) for validation parameters.
  - Add comments to the code indicating that these values must be kept in sync with the Music.AI API.
- **Testing Focus**: Unit tests to ensure the validation logic correctly uses the shared constants.

### 3. SEC-001: Bypassing Client-Side Validation (Score: 3 - Low)

- **Description**: An attacker could bypass the client-side validation and send an invalid file directly to the backend.
- **Mitigation**:
  - **This is the most critical point**: This client-side check is a UX enhancement, NOT a security measure. The story's `Dev Notes` must explicitly state that robust server-side validation must not be removed or relaxed.
- **Testing Focus**: E2E tests that attempt to bypass the UI and submit invalid files directly to the backend API endpoints to ensure they are rejected.

### 4. TECH-002: UI Blocking (Score: 2 - Low)

- **Description**: Reading audio metadata on large files could block the UI thread.
- **Mitigation**:
  - Ensure file reading is done asynchronously. The story's acceptance criteria already covers this.
- **Testing Focus**: Manual performance testing with files close to the 50MB limit on mid-range devices.

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Create a test suite of various audio files (different formats, bitrates) to run through the validation logic in an automated E2E test across different browser configurations.
- **BUS-001**: Write unit tests confirming that the validation function imports and uses values from a central `constants.ts` file.

### Priority 2: Low Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**: Write an E2E test that uses `fetch` or a similar tool to directly POST an oversized file to the pre-signed URL generation endpoint, ensuring it's handled gracefully.
- **TECH-002**: Manually test the UI with a ~45MB file on a throttled network/CPU profile in browser dev tools to check for UI responsiveness.
