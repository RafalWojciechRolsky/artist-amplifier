- Manual tests: 1 (12%)
- Priority distribution: P0: 7, P1: 1, P2: 0

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: The frontend file upload component is modified to request a signed URL from the backend.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-INT-001 | Integration | P0 | Verify that the `AudioUpload` component correctly calls the `/api/upload` endpoint and receives a signed URL. | Tests the critical interaction between the frontend and the new backend endpoint. |

### AC2: A new backend endpoint is created to generate and return a Vercel Blob signed URL for uploading.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-UNIT-001 | Unit | P0 | Test the `/api/upload` route handler to ensure it correctly generates a signed URL. | Pure backend logic that can be tested in isolation. |
| 3.2-INT-002 | Integration | P1 | Test the `/api/upload` endpoint with a real request to ensure it returns a valid signed URL from Vercel Blob. | Verifies the actual integration with the Vercel Blob service. |

### AC3: The file is uploaded directly from the client to Vercel Blob using the signed URL.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-E2E-001 | E2E | P0 | Simulate a file upload from the client using a signed URL and verify that the file appears in the Vercel Blob storage. | Critical user journey that needs to be tested end-to-end. |

### AC4: The backend analysis endpoint is updated to accept the Vercel Blob URL of the uploaded file instead of the file itself.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-UNIT-002 | Unit | P0 | Test the logic in the `/api/audio/analyze` route handler that downloads the file from the provided URL. | Specific backend logic that can be tested in isolation. |
| 3.2-INT-003 | Integration | P0 | Call the `/api/audio/analyze` endpoint with a valid Vercel Blob URL and verify that the analysis is triggered correctly. | Tests the interaction between the analysis endpoint and Vercel Blob storage. |

### AC5: The application correctly handles the entire workflow.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-E2E-002 | E2E | P0 | Test the entire workflow from the user selecting a file to the analysis being completed successfully. | Main happy path for the new feature. |

### AC6: The solution is compliant with the security and architecture guidelines.

| ID | Level | Priority | Test | Justification |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 3.2-SEC-001 | Manual | P0 | Manually review the code to ensure that no secret keys are exposed on the client-side. | Critical security requirement best verified by manual code review. |

## Risk Coverage

| Risk ID | Mitigating Test IDs |
|---|---|
| TECH-001 | 3.2-INT-001, 3.2-INT-002, 3.2-E2E-002 |
| SEC-001 | 3.2-UNIT-001, 3.2-SEC-001 |
| PERF-001 | 3.2-E2E-001 |
| DATA-001 | 3.2-E2E-001, 3.2-UNIT-002, 3.2-INT-003 |

## Recommended Execution Order

1.  P0 Unit tests
2.  P0 Integration tests
3.  P0 E2E tests
4.  P0 Manual tests
5.  P1 tests
