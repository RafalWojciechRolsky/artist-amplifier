# Risk Profile: Story 2.1

Date: 2025-08-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 71/100

The primary risks for this story are **High** and related to the dependency on the external Music.ai service (availability and performance). While there are no critical blockers, a focus on robust error handling, performance monitoring, and secure key management is essential.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

None identified.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                            | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy                                                                       |
| :------- | :------------------------------------- | :---------- | :--------- | :---- | :------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TECH-001 | External Service Dependency (Music.ai) | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Implement robust retry logic and error handling; monitor service availability.            |
| PERF-001 | Long Processing Time                   | High (3)    | Medium (2) | 6     | High     | Provide clear, continuous feedback to the user; log step durations to find bottlenecks.   |
| TECH-002 | Inaccurate Analysis from Music.ai      | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | Allow user to edit the final generated text; engineer prompts to handle generic analysis. |
| SEC-001  | API Key Exposure                       | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      | Ensure keys are only used in the BFF and never exposed to the client; use `.gitignore`.   |
| OPS-001  | Temporary File Handling                | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Use a `finally` block to ensure temporary files are always deleted after processing.      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests (Score 6)

- **TECH-001 (Service Dependency):**
  - **Scenario:** Music.ai API returns a 5xx server error.
  - **Test:** Verify that the BFF retries a configurable number of times and then returns a standard `ApiError` with code 502.
  - **Scenario:** Music.ai API returns a 429 "Too Many Requests" error.
  - **Test:** Verify the exponential backoff mechanism is triggered and the request eventually succeeds or fails gracefully.
- **PERF-001 (Long Processing):**
  - **Scenario:** Upload a large audio file (e.g., 45MB).
  - **Test:** Measure the end-to-end response time. Verify the client shows a continuous loading state and does not time out prematurely.

### Priority 2: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-002 (Inaccurate Analysis):**
  - **Test:** Process several audio files of varying genres and quality. Manually review the `AudioAnalysis` object to ensure the results are plausible.
- **SEC-001 (Key Exposure):**
  - **Test:** Manually review the codebase to confirm that `process.env.MUSIC_AI_API_KEY` is not used in any file under `src/components` or `src/lib/api`.
- **OPS-001 (File Handling):**
  - **Test:** After a successful and a failed API request, manually inspect the temporary directory on the server to ensure the uploaded file has been deleted.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All **High** risks (score 6) must have their primary mitigation strategies implemented.
  - Robust retry/error handling for API calls.
  - Cleanup of temporary files.
  - Clear user feedback during long processing times.

### Accepted Risks

- The inherent risk of the Music.ai service providing a low-quality analysis (TECH-002) is accepted for the MVP, as the user can edit the final output.

## Monitoring Requirements

- **Post-deployment:**
  - **Metric:** Duration of the `/api/audio/generate` endpoint.
  - **Alert:** Configure an alert if the p95 response time exceeds a defined threshold (e.g., 120 seconds).
  - **Metric:** Rate of 5xx errors from the Music.ai integration.
  - **Alert:** Configure an alert if the error rate exceeds a certain percentage over a 5-minute window.
