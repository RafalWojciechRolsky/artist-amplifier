Date: 2025-08-31
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 68/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. SEC-001: API Key Leakage

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Low - The development notes are clear about keeping the key on the server side, but human error is possible.
**Impact**: High - Unauthorized use of the API key could lead to significant financial costs and service disruption.
**Mitigation**:
- Ensure `LLM_API_KEY` is only accessed via server-side environment variables and never exposed in client-side code.
- Implement CI checks or pre-commit hooks to scan for accidentally committed secrets.
- Use a dedicated secret management solution for production environments.
  **Testing Focus**: Rigorous code review of all new code to ensure no leakage. Static Application Security Testing (SAST) to detect potential secret exposure.

### 2. BUS-001: Unexpected High Cost

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Usage patterns for a new feature are inherently unpredictable.
**Impact**: High - Without controls, API usage could exceed budget, leading to financial strain.
**Mitigation**:
- Configure billing alerts and hard spending limits in the LLM provider's dashboard.
- Implement detailed logging of token usage for each API call to enable cost monitoring.
- Consider adding rate limiting per user on the `/api/audio/generate` endpoint to prevent abuse.
  **Testing Focus**: N/A (Focus on operational readiness and monitoring).

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **SEC-001:**
    - Conduct a thorough code review of `src/lib/server/llm.ts` and any related configuration to confirm the API key is not exposed.
    - Manually verify that no environment variables related to the LLM are present in the client-side bundle.
- **BUS-001:**
    - Operationally verify that billing alerts and spending limits are correctly configured with the LLM provider.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-001:**
    - Write integration tests for `src/app/api/audio/generate/route.ts` that mock the LLM API and simulate 5xx and 429 responses to ensure the retry logic and error handling work as expected.
- **PERF-001:**
    - During manual testing, note the response time of the generation step. While full load testing isn't required by the story, egregious delays (>15 seconds) should be reported.
- **DATA-001:**
    - Perform manual, exploratory testing with a diverse set of inputs (different artist names, descriptions, and audio analysis results) to assess the quality and relevance of the generated text.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All High risks (score 6+) must have their mitigation strategies implemented and verified.
- `SEC-001`: Confirmed no key leakage.
- `BUS-001`: Confirmed billing alerts are active.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All Medium risks can be deployed as long as the recommended monitoring and error handling are in place.

## Monitoring Requirements

- **Cost:** Monitor LLM API costs daily/weekly.
- **Performance:** Track the p95 and p99 latency of the `/api/audio/generate` endpoint.
- **Errors:** Create alerts for a spike in 5xx or 4xx errors from the LLM provider.
