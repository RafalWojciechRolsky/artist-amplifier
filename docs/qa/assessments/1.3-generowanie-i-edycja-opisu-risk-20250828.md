## Detailed Risk Register

### TECH-001: LLM API integration failures/timeouts
- Description: External dependency may fail or be slow (network, quota, provider issues).
- Probability: High (3)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 6 (High)
- Mitigation (preventive/corrective):
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff and circuit breaker.
  - Timeouts with graceful degradation and retry CTA.
  - Map provider errors to user-friendly messages.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Inject failures/timeouts in route handler and assert UI states and retries.
  - Contract tests for error mapping.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: Before merging to main

### PERF-001: Slow LLM response affects UX
- Description: Generation latency degrades perceived performance and increases abandonment.
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: High (3)
- Score: 6 (High)
- Mitigation (preventive/monitor):
  - Clear progressive states: "Analiza audio..." → "Generowanie...".
  - Optimize prompt size; consider streaming or partial UX.
  - Add telemetry for latency; SLO for P95.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Simulate slow responses; verify loading states and cancellation.
  - Measure and assert latency budgets in integration tests.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: Before release

### TECH-002: Inaccurate audio analysis reduces description quality
- Description: Weak/incorrect analysis data leads to poor generation; user can edit but increases effort.
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Mitigation (preventive):
  - Validate analysis outputs; guardrails in prompt to handle uncertainty.
  - Fine-tune prompt with examples; fallback to artist-provided metadata when low confidence.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Use diverse audio fixtures; verify prompt construction with/without optional fields.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: During implementation

### BUS-001: Unclear error messaging confuses users
- Description: Users may not know how to recover from analysis/generation errors.
- Probability: Medium (2)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 4 (Medium)
- Mitigation (preventive):
  - Apply FE error copy guidelines; actionable recovery steps.
  - Distinguish between analysis vs generation failures.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Snapshot tests of error states; usability review checklist.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: During implementation

### DATA-001: Loss of user edits during session
- Description: Edits in textarea could be lost if persistence logic is flawed.
- Probability: Low (1)
- Impact: High (3)
- Score: 3 (Low)
- Mitigation (preventive/detective):
  - Auto-save to sessionStorage on change with throttling; restore on load.
  - E2E test for refresh recovery; protect against storage quota errors.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Unit tests for persistence utilities and reducer actions.
  - Integration test for refresh → state restore.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: Before merge

### SEC-001: Prompt-injection via user inputs to LLM
- Description: Malicious inputs could steer model to unsafe outputs.
- Probability: Low (1)
- Impact: High (3)
- Score: 3 (Low)
- Mitigation (preventive):
  - Sanitize inputs; constrain system prompt; apply output moderation/validation.
  - Avoid blind tool use; include safety instructions in prompt.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Red-team strings; assert filters and safe fallbacks.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: Before release

### OPS-001: sessionStorage/browser compatibility edge cases
- Description: Private modes or quota differences may block persistence.
- Probability: Low (1)
- Impact: Medium (2)
- Score: 2 (Low)
- Mitigation (detective/monitor):
  - Graceful no-storage fallback with in-memory state.
  - Cross-browser smoke tests; telemetry for storage failures.
- Testing Requirements:
  - Browser matrix test; simulate storage exceptions.
- Owner: dev
- Timeline: During QA

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- Failure/timeout injection tests for API integration with retry logic and UI recovery.
- Latency simulation tests with assertions on states and cancellation.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- Prompt construction with variable analysis quality; ensure sensible outputs.
- Error message clarity and recovery paths.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests
- Persistence auto-save/restore; storage quota/denied scenarios.
- Security red-team inputs; output validation.
- Cross-browser sessionStorage behavior.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- Any new Critical (score 9) — none currently.
- All High (score 6): TECH-001, PERF-001.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- Medium risks with compensating controls: TECH-002, BUS-001.

### Accepted Risks
- Low risks with monitoring: DATA-001, SEC-001, OPS-001 (team to review and sign-off if unchanged).

## Monitoring Requirements
- Latency metrics (P50/P95) for generation; alert on breaches.
- Error rates by cause (analysis vs generation vs transport).
- Security/malformed input events.
- Storage failure telemetry.

## Risk Review Triggers
- Changes to LLM provider, prompt, or analysis pipeline.
- New error patterns, latency regressions, or security advisories.
- Architecture changes to state/persistence or API routes.
