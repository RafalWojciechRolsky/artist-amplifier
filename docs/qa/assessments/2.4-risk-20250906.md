# Risk Profile: Story 2.4

Date: 2025-09-06
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 0
- Risk Score: 81/100 (calculated: 100 - 20 (OPS-001) - 5 (TECH-001) - 5 (TECH-002) - 2 (SEC-001) - 2 (BUS-001))

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. OPS-001: CI misconfiguration

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Initial setup often has small errors or omissions.
**Impact**: High (3) - Can lead to bad code being merged, undermining the purpose of CI.
**Mitigation**:

- Thorough review of `ci.yml` by another developer.
- Create a dedicated test pull request (as per AC2 and Task 2 of the story) to verify all aspects of the CI (triggering, passing, blocking).
- Implement automated checks for `ci.yml` syntax (e.g., `actionlint`).
  **Testing Focus**: Dedicated test PRs (passing and failing scenarios).

## Risk Distribution

### By Category

- Technical: 2 risks (0 critical)
- Security: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Operational: 1 risk (1 critical)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component

- `.github/workflows/ci.yml`: 3 risks
- Development process/team culture: 1 risk
- `package.json`/`package-lock.json`/`npm ci`: 1 risk

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                 | Category    | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| OPS-001  | CI misconfiguration         | Operational | High (3)    | High (3) | 9     | Critical |
| TECH-001 | CI pipeline instability     | Technical   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-002 | Slow CI execution           | Technical   | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| SEC-001  | Supply chain vulnerability  | Security    | Low (1)     | High (3) | 3     | Low      |
| BUS-001  | False sense of security     | Business    | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **OPS-001: CI misconfiguration**
  - Test scenarios: Create dedicated test PRs (one expected to pass, one expected to fail) to thoroughly validate the CI workflow's triggering, execution, passing, and blocking behavior.
  - Required test types: E2E testing within GitHub Actions.
  - Test environment requirements: A GitHub repository with the CI workflow configured.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- None

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **TECH-001: CI pipeline instability**
  - Test scenarios: Monitor CI dashboard for flakiness, analyze failure logs.
  - Required test types: Observational testing, log analysis.
- **TECH-002: Slow CI execution**
  - Test scenarios: Monitor CI build times, identify bottlenecks.
  - Required test types: Performance monitoring.
- **SEC-001: Supply chain vulnerability in CI**
  - Test scenarios: Regular `npm audit` runs, integration of dependency scanning tools.
  - Required test types: Security scanning.
- **BUS-001: False sense of security**
  - Test scenarios: N/A (more of a process/cultural aspect, not directly testable via automated tests).

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- OPS-001 (CI misconfiguration) must be thoroughly verified through dedicated test PRs.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- TECH-001 (CI pipeline instability), TECH-002 (Slow CI execution), SEC-001 (Supply chain vulnerability), BUS-001 (False sense of security) can be deployed with ongoing monitoring and mitigation efforts.

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- CI run success/failure rates and build times.
- Alerts for unexpected CI failures.
- Dependency vulnerability reports.

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- CI workflow changes significantly.
- New dependencies are introduced.
- Production bugs related to code quality or CI are reported.
