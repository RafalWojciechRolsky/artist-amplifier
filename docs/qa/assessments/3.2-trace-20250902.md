# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 3.2 - Refactor File Upload to Use Vercel Blob

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 6
- Fully Covered: 6 (100%)
- Partially Covered: 0 (0%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: The frontend file upload component is modified to request a signed URL from the backend.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Integration Test**: `3.2-INT-001`
  - Given: A user has selected a file in the `AudioUpload` component.
  - When: The user initiates the upload process.
  - Then: The component calls the `/api/upload` endpoint and receives a signed URL.

#### AC2: A new backend endpoint is created to generate and return a Vercel Blob signed URL for uploading.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Unit Test**: `3.2-UNIT-001`
  - Given: A request with a valid filename and content type.
  - When: The `/api/upload` route handler is called.
  - Then: It returns a valid signed URL.
- **Integration Test**: `3.2-INT-002`
  - Given: A valid request to the `/api/upload` endpoint.
  - When: The endpoint is called.
  - Then: It returns a successful response with a signed URL from Vercel Blob.

#### AC3: The file is uploaded directly from the client to Vercel Blob using the signed URL.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **E2E Test**: `3.2-E2E-001`
  - Given: The user has a signed URL for a file.
  - When: The user uploads the file using the signed URL.
  - Then: The file is successfully uploaded to Vercel Blob storage.

#### AC4: The backend analysis endpoint is updated to accept the Vercel Blob URL of the uploaded file instead of the file itself.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Unit Test**: `3.2-UNIT-002`
  - Given: A valid Vercel Blob URL.
  - When: The `/api/audio/analyze` route handler is called.
  - Then: It successfully downloads the file from the URL.
- **Integration Test**: `3.2-INT-003`
  - Given: A valid Vercel Blob URL for an audio file.
  - When: The `/api/audio/analyze` endpoint is called with the URL.
  - Then: The analysis is triggered successfully.

#### AC5: The application correctly handles the entire workflow: signed URL generation, file upload, and passing the URL to the analysis endpoint.

**Coverage: FULL**

- **E2E Test**: `3.2-E2E-002`
  - Given: A user is on the main page.
  - When: The user selects a file, gets a signed URL, uploads the file, and initiates the analysis.
  - Then: The analysis is completed successfully.

#### AC6: The solution is compliant with the security and architecture guidelines (no keys on the client).

**Coverage: FULL**

- **Manual Test**: `3.2-SEC-001`
  - Given: The application code.
  - When: A developer reviews the code.
  - Then: No secret keys are found on the client-side.

### Critical Gaps
