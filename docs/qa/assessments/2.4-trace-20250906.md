# Requirements Traceability Matrix

## Story: 2.4 - Implementacja podstawowego workflow CI

### Coverage Summary

- Total Requirements: 2
- Fully Covered: 1 (50%)
- Partially Covered: 1 (50%)
- Not Covered: 0 (0%)

### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: A basic CI workflow is implemented that runs linting, tests, and the build process on every pull request.

**Coverage: FULL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **CI Workflow Definition**: `.github/workflows/ci.yml`
  - Given: A pull request is opened to the `develop` branch.
  - When: The GitHub Actions workflow `ci.yml` is triggered.
  - Then: The workflow executes `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, and `npm run build`.

#### AC2: The CI workflow passes successfully on a test pull request.

**Coverage: PARTIAL**

Given-When-Then Mappings:

- **Manual Verification (Task 2)**: `docs/stories/2.4.implementacja-workflow-ci.md`
  - Given: A test pull request is created.
  - When: The CI workflow runs on the test pull request.
  - Then: All steps (lint, test, build) pass successfully, and the pull request is not blocked due to CI failure.

### Critical Gaps

1.  **CI Workflow Verification**
    - Gap: Task 2 ("Verify CI Workflow") is incomplete, meaning the successful execution of the CI workflow on a test pull request has not been confirmed.
    - Risk: Medium - The CI workflow is defined, but its practical effectiveness in preventing issues is not yet validated.
    - Action: Complete Task 2 by creating a test pull request and verifying its successful execution and blocking behavior on failure.

### Test Design Recommendations

Based on gaps identified, recommend:

1.  **Additional Test Scenarios Needed:**
    *   A dedicated test pull request to the `develop` branch that is expected to pass.
    *   A dedicated test pull request to the `develop` branch that is expected to fail (e.g., with linting errors or failing tests) to confirm blocking behavior.
2.  **Test Types to Implement:** Manual verification of GitHub Actions workflow runs.
3.  **Test Data Requirements:** A sample branch with changes that trigger the CI.
4.  **Mock/Stub Strategies:** Not applicable for this level of testing.

### Risk Assessment

- **High Risk**: None
- **Medium Risk**: AC2 has partial coverage due to unverified manual testing.
- **Low Risk**: AC1 is fully covered by the workflow definition.
