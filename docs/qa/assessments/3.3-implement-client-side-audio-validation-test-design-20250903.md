# Test Design: Story 3.3 - Implement Client-Side Audio Validation

Date: 2025-09-03
Designer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Test Strategy Overview

This test strategy prioritizes validating the core business logic at the unit level for speed and efficiency. Critical user-facing paths, including error feedback, are covered by P0 End-to-End tests. The design also includes specific tests to address risks identified in the associated risk profile, such as performance and security concerns.

- **Total test scenarios**: 10
- **Unit tests**: 6 (60%)
- **Integration tests**: 1 (10%)
- **E2E tests**: 3 (30%)
- **Priority distribution**: P0: 3, P1: 4, P2: 3

## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC 1 & 2: Validation Logic (File Size & Duration)

These scenarios focus on the pure validation logic within the `validateAudioFile` utility function.

| ID           | Level | Priority | Test Description                                      | Justification                                      |
|--------------|-------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| 3.3-UNIT-001 | Unit  | P1       | Validate with a file under all limits (e.g., 40MB, 5 min) | Tests the core "happy path" logic.                 |
| 3.3-UNIT-002 | Unit  | P1       | Validate with a file > 50MB                           | Covers the maximum file size constraint.           |
| 3.3-UNIT-003 | Unit  | P1       | Validate with a file > 10 minutes duration            | Covers the maximum duration constraint.            |
| 3.3-UNIT-004 | Unit  | P2       | Validate with a file that is both too large and too long | Verifies handling of multiple validation failures. |
| 3.3-UNIT-005 | Unit  | P2       | Validate with a file exactly at the size limit (50MB) | Checks edge case handling for file size.           |
| 3.3-UNIT-006 | Unit  | P2       | Validate with a non-audio file type (e.g., .txt, .jpg)  | Ensures the function handles incorrect file types. |

### AC 3 & 4: UI Feedback and Workflow

These E2E scenarios ensure the user receives the correct feedback and the application flow is controlled correctly.

| ID          | Level | Priority | Test Description                                                                | Justification                                                              |
|-------------|-------|----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.3-E2E-001 | E2E   | P0       | User selects a valid file, sees no error, and the upload process proceeds.      | Validates the primary critical path for the user.                          |
| 3.3-E2E-002 | E2E   | P0       | User selects an oversized file, sees a "File is too large" error, and upload is blocked. | Validates the critical error feedback path for the most common error.      |
| 3.3-E2E-003 | E2E   | P0       | User selects an over-duration file, sees an "Audio is too long" error, and upload is blocked. | Validates the critical error feedback path for the second validation rule. |

### AC 5: Non-blocking UI

This scenario addresses the performance requirement of the validation.

| ID          | Level | Priority | Test Description                                                              | Justification                                                              |
|-------------|-------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.3-E2E-004 | E2E   | P1       | With a large file (~49MB), the UI remains responsive during validation.       | Directly tests the performance and non-blocking nature of the implementation. |

## Risk-Based Scenarios

These scenarios are designed to mitigate risks identified in the `risk-profile` assessment.

| ID           | Level       | Priority | Test Description                                                              | Justification & Mitigated Risk(s)                                          |
|--------------|-------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 3.3-INT-001  | Integration | P1       | Directly call backend APIs to attempt an upload with invalid file parameters. | Ensures server-side validation exists and is not bypassed. (Mitigates: SEC-001) |

## Recommended Execution Order

1.  **Unit Tests (P1, P2)**: Run first for fast feedback on core logic.
2.  **E2E Tests (P0)**: Run next to validate critical user-facing paths.
3.  **Integration Test (P1)**: Verify security assumptions about the backend.
4.  **E2E Performance Test (P1)**: Can be run last or manually as it may be slower.
