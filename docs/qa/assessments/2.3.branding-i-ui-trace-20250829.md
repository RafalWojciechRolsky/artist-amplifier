### Requirement Mappings

#### AC1: UI jest zgodny z sekcjami „Branding”, „Komponenty”, „A11y” w `docs/front-end-spec.md`

**Coverage: FULL**

This requirement is validated by a combination of unit, integration, and E2E tests designed to verify each aspect of the UI overhaul.

- **Test(s)**: `2.3-UNIT-001`, `2.3-E2E-002`, `2.3-INT-003`, `2.3-INT-004`, `2.3-INT-005`, `2.3-INT-006`, `2.3-E2E-007`, `2.3-INT-008`, `2.3-E2E-009`, `2.3-E2E-010`, `2.3-UNIT-011`
  - **Given**: The application is running.
  - **When**: A user interacts with the UI, or an automated test inspects the styles and component states.
  - **Then**: The branding (colors), component appearance/behavior (buttons, inputs), and accessibility features (focus states, contrast) match the specifications in `front-end-spec.md`.

#### AC2: Smoke 1→4 przechodzi na mobile i desktop; brak regresji Stories 1.1–1.4

**Coverage: FULL**

This requirement is validated by a suite of P0 end-to-end regression tests that cover the critical user path defined in stories 1.1 through 1.4.

- **Test(s)**: `2.3-E2E-012`, `2.3-E2E-013`, `2.3-E2E-014`, `2.3-E2E-015`, `2.3-E2E-016`
  - **Given**: The application has the new UI branding applied.
  - **When**: A user performs the end-to-end workflow of providing artist info, uploading a song, generating a description, and using it.
  - **Then**: The entire workflow completes without any errors or unexpected behavior on both mobile and desktop viewports.

### Critical Gaps

- None. All requirements are covered by the test plan.

### Test Design Recommendations

- It is recommended to automate the E2E regression suite (AC2) to ensure these critical checks are performed consistently.
- The visual verification (`2.3-E2E-002`) may require manual review or could be automated with a visual regression testing tool.
