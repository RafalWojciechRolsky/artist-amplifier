# Risk Profile: Story 2.3

Date: 2025-08-29
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 5
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 63/100

The primary risk for this story is a **Critical** regression risk (TECH-001) due to the widespread changes in shared UI components. There is also a **High** risk of introducing accessibility issues (TECH-003). Mitigation requires extensive regression and accessibility testing.

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. [TECH-001]: Regression in Existing Functionality

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Changes to core components like `Button` and `Input` are almost certain to affect other parts of the application.
**Impact**: High - A regression could break core user flows from stories 1.1-1.4, rendering the application unusable for its primary purpose.
**Mitigation**:
- **Preventive**: The developer must adhere strictly to component props and APIs.
- **Detective**: A full manual smoke test of flows 1.1 through 1.4 is mandatory, as per the acceptance criteria. Automated visual regression tests should be considered.
  **Testing Focus**: Execute end-to-end scenarios for creating an artist profile, uploading a track, generating a description, and using the output. Test on both desktop and mobile viewports.

## Risk Distribution

### By Category
- Technical: 3 risks (1 critical)
- Business: 1 risk (0 critical)
- Performance: 1 risk (0 critical)

### By Component
- `src/components/*`: 3 risks
- `src/app/globals.css`: 2 risks
- `src/app/page.tsx`: 2 risks

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID | Description | Probability | Impact | Score | Priority | Mitigation Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| TECH-001 | Regression in Existing Functionality | High (3) | High (3) | 9 | Critical | Full regression testing of stories 1.1-1.4. |
| TECH-003 | Accessibility (A11y) Violations | Medium (2) | High (3) | 6 | High | Automated (Axe) and manual (keyboard nav, contrast check) A11y testing. |
| TECH-002 | Inconsistent UI Implementation | Medium (2) | Medium (2) | 4 | Medium | Thorough code/design review to ensure use of CSS variables. |
| BUS-001 | Visual Design Does Not Meet User Expectations | Low (1) | Medium (2) | 2 | Low | Acceptable risk for MVP; gather user feedback post-release. |
| PERF-001 | Performance Degradation from New CSS/Components | Low (1) | Low (1) | 1 | Minimal | Monitor Lighthouse scores; unlikely to be an issue. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests (TECH-001)
- **Scenario**: User completes the entire workflow from story 1.1 to 1.4 without error.
- **Test Types**: Manual E2E, Visual Regression (if possible).
- **Data**: A sample audio file (`.mp3`/`.wav` < 50MB).

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests (TECH-003)
- **Scenario**: All interactive elements have a visible focus state and can be operated by keyboard. All text has a contrast ratio of at least 4.5:1.
- **Test Types**: Manual Keyboard Navigation, Automated Axe Scan, Color Contrast Check.
- **Data**: N/A.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests
- **Scenario**: All components match the design spec.
- **Test Types**: Manual Visual Inspection.
- **Data**: N/A.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- All regressions in flows 1.1-1.4 must be fixed.
- All critical accessibility violations (e.g., unusable by keyboard) must be fixed.
- Color contrast ratios must meet the 4.5:1 requirement.

### Accepted Risks
- Minor visual inconsistencies not affecting core UX can be accepted and logged as technical debt.
- The business risk (BUS-001) is accepted for the MVP.

## Monitoring Requirements
- Post-deployment, monitor for any new user-reported bugs related to the UI.
- Monitor error rates to catch any unexpected side effects of the changes.
