## Test Scenarios by Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: A basic CI workflow is implemented that runs linting, tests, and the build process on every pull request.

#### Scenarios

| ID           | Level       | Priority | Test                                                              | Justification                                     |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.4-INT-001  | Integration | P0       | Verify CI workflow file (.github/workflows/ci.yml) exists and has correct structure. | Foundational configuration for CI pipeline.       |
| 2.4-E2E-001  | E2E         | P0       | Verify CI workflow triggers on pull request to the develop branch. | Critical for CI pipeline initiation.              |
| 2.4-INT-002  | Integration | P1       | Verify CI workflow executes linting step.                         | Ensures code quality checks are performed.        |
| 2.4-INT-003  | Integration | P0       | Verify CI workflow executes test step.                            | Ensures automated tests are run to prevent bugs.  |
| 2.4-INT-004  | Integration | P0       | Verify CI workflow executes build step.                           | Ensures application can be built successfully.    |

### AC2: The CI workflow passes successfully on a test pull request.

#### Scenarios

| ID           | Level       | Priority | Test                                                              | Justification                                     |
| ------------ | ----------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| 2.4-E2E-002  | E2E         | P0       | Verify CI workflow passes successfully on a valid test pull request. | Confirms end-to-end functionality of the CI pipeline for good code. |
| 2.4-E2E-003  | E2E         | P0       | Verify CI workflow blocks pull request when linting fails.        | Critical quality gate enforcement.                |
| 2.4-E2E-004  | E2E         | P0       | Verify CI workflow blocks pull request when tests fail.           | Critical quality gate enforcement.                |
| 2.4-E2E-005  | E2E         | P0       | Verify CI workflow blocks pull request when build fails.          | Critical quality gate enforcement.                |

## Risk Coverage

[No specific risks identified in the story beyond general quality and bug prevention, which are covered by the P0 tests.]

## Recommended Execution Order

1. P0 Integration tests (2.4-INT-001, 2.4-INT-003, 2.4-INT-004)
2. P0 E2E tests (2.4-E2E-001, 2.4-E2E-002, 2.4-E2E-003, 2.4-E2E-004, 2.4-E2E-005)
3. P1 Integration tests (2.4-INT-002)
