Date: 2025-09-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 83/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [SEC-001]: Insufficient input validation

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Developers might overlook sanitization for a simple text field.
**Impact**: High - If the song title is displayed without proper escaping, it could lead to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict server-side validation and sanitization for the `songTitle` field.
- Use a validation library like `zod` to define and enforce rules.
- Always escape the `songTitle` on the client-side before rendering it in the DOM.
**Testing Focus**:
- Unit tests for input validation and sanitization logic.
- Manual or automated security tests using common XSS payloads.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                            | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation Actions                                                                                             | Testing Requirements                                            |
| -------- | -------------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| SEC-001  | Insufficient input validation          | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     | Implement server-side validation and sanitization; escape all outputs.                                         | Unit tests for validation; security tests with XSS payloads.    |
| BUS-001  | Negative impact on description quality | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   | A/B test or qualitatively analyze generated descriptions; refine LLM prompt based on findings.                 | Manual review of generated descriptions.                        |
| DATA-001 | Data model inconsistency               | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Rely on TypeScript compiler; perform a global search for `ArtistInput` type usage to ensure all instances are updated. | Existing unit and integration tests should provide coverage.    |
| TECH-001 | Integration with existing form         | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Follow existing coding patterns for form field implementation.                                                 | Component unit tests for `ArtistForm`; E2E tests for the form. |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests
- **SEC-001**:
  - Test Scenario: Submit a form with the `songTitle` containing `<script>alert('XSS')</script>`.
  - Expected Result: The script is sanitized on the backend and rendered as inert text on the frontend.
  - Test Type: Manual/Automated Security Test.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests
- **BUS-001**:
  - Test Scenario: Generate descriptions for 5-10 different songs, providing a title for each.
  - Expected Result: The generated descriptions should be coherent, relevant, and enhanced by the context of the song title.
  - Test Type: Manual, Qualitative Review.

### Priority 3: Low/Minimal Risk Tests
- **DATA-001 & TECH-001**:
  - These risks are best covered by the existing test suite. Ensure unit tests for `ArtistForm` and E2E tests for the submission flow are updated to include the new field.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production
- **SEC-001**: The risk of XSS must be fully mitigated through proper validation and output escaping.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation
- **BUS-001**: The feature can be deployed, but the impact on description quality must be monitored.

## Monitoring Requirements
- **BUS-001**: Monitor user feedback and sentiment regarding the quality of the generated descriptions after deployment.
