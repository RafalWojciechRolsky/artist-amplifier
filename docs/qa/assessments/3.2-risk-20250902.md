# Risk Profile: Story 3.2

Date: 2025-09-02
Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 4
- Critical Risks: 0
- High Risks: 1
- Risk Score: 75/100

## High Risks Requiring Attention

### 1. [DATA-001]: Incomplete or Corrupted Uploads

**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium - Network interruptions are a common issue for client-side uploads.
**Impact**: High - Corrupted files will cause the primary workflow (audio analysis) to fail, requiring user intervention.
**Mitigation**:

- Implement checksum validation on the backend to verify file integrity after upload.
- Provide clear feedback to the user on upload progress and any failures.
- Implement a retry mechanism on the frontend for failed uploads.

**Testing Focus**: Simulate network interruptions during E2E tests; add unit tests for checksum validation.

## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                        | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- |
| DATA-001 | Incomplete or Corrupted Uploads    | Medium (2)  | High (3)   | 6     | High     |
| TECH-001 | Vercel Blob Integration Complexity | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| PERF-001 | Slow File Uploads                  | Medium (2)  | Medium (2) | 4     | Medium   |
| SEC-001  | Insecure Signed URL Handling       | Low (1)     | High (3)   | 3     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **DATA-001**: 
    - E2E Test: Simulate a network interruption during the file upload and verify that the UI displays an error and allows the user to retry.
    - Integration Test: Send a corrupted file URL to the analysis endpoint and verify that it fails gracefully.

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**:
    - Integration Test: Verify the end-to-end flow of getting a signed URL, uploading a file, and passing the URL to the analysis endpoint.
- **PERF-001**:
    - Manual Test: Upload files of various sizes (1MB, 10MB, 50MB) and measure the upload time on different network conditions.

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- **SEC-001**:
    - Code Review: Manually review the code for the signed URL generation to ensure it has a short expiration and follows best practices.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6+) must have their mitigation strategies implemented and tested.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls (e.g., monitoring, feature flags).

### Accepted Risks

- Low-priority risks can be accepted with a plan for future monitoring.
