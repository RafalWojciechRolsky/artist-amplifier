## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                 | Probability | Impact     | Score | Priority | Mitigation                                                                                               |
| -------- | --------------------------- | ----------- | ---------- | ----- | -------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TECH-001 | Clipboard API compatibility | Medium (2)  | Low (1)    | 2     | Low      | Use a well-tested library for clipboard interaction or provide a fallback for older browsers.            |
| DATA-001 | Incomplete data reset       | Low (1)     | Medium (2) | 2     | Low      | Ensure the `RESET` action in the reducer explicitly removes all relevant keys from `sessionStorage`.       |
| TECH-002 | File download issues        | Low (1)     | Low (1)    | 1     | Minimal  | Create the download link programmatically and trigger a click.                                           |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

None.

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Test "Copy to clipboard" functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
- Write a unit test to verify that all specified `sessionStorage` keys are cleared after the `RESET` action.
- Test "Pobierz jako .txt" functionality on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge to ensure the file download is not blocked.

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

None.

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified risks can be deployed with the proposed mitigation and testing.

### Accepted Risks

None.

## Monitoring Requirements

- Monitor clipboard and download functionality across different browsers.

## Risk Review Triggers

- Review and update risk profile if new browsers or browser versions show issues with the clipboard or download functionality.
