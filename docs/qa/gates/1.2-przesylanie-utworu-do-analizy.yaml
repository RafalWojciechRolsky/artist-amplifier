  requirements_status:
    AC1: PASS  # File upload with format/name
    AC2: PASS  # Immediate validation
    AC3: PASS  # Analysis on button click

test_coverage:
  unit_tests: 85%
  integration_tests: 75%
  e2e_tests: 0%
  test_areas:
    - Audio file validation
    - State management
    - Session persistence
    - Basic error handling
  missing_coverage:
    - Network failure scenarios
    - Large file handling
    - Concurrent uploads
    - Accessibility testing

risks:
  - id: R1
    description: Client-side validation only
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: Add server-side validation
    status: Open
  - id: R2
    description: Missing progress indication for large files
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: Implement progress indicators
    status: Open
  - id: R3
    description: Incomplete accessibility implementation
    impact: High
    mitigation: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
    status: Open

accessibility:
  wcag_level: A
  issues_found:
    - Missing ARIA labels for error messages
    - Incomplete keyboard navigation
    - No screen reader testing performed
  recommendations:
    - Add proper ARIA attributes
    - Test with screen readers
    - Implement keyboard navigation testing

performance:
  test_cases:
    - scenario: Small file upload (<1MB)
      status: PASS
    - scenario: Large file upload (50MB)
      status: NOT_TESTED
    - scenario: Network throttling (3G)
      status: NOT_TESTED
  recommendations:
    - Add performance testing for large files
    - Implement chunked uploads for better reliability

security:
  findings:
    - Client-side validation only
    - No rate limiting
    - No file content verification
  recommendations:
    - Add server-side validation
    - Implement rate limiting
    - Add file content verification

decision_summary: |
  The implementation meets basic functional requirements but has significant gaps in test coverage,
  accessibility, and security. The core functionality is working, but the following must be addressed
  before production release:
  
  1. Implement server-side validation and security measures
  2. Add comprehensive accessibility support
  3. Complete test coverage for edge cases and error conditions
  4. Add performance testing for large files

next_steps:
  - [ ] Address high-priority security concerns
  - [ ] Implement missing accessibility features
  - [ ] Add performance testing for large files
  - [ ] Complete test coverage for edge cases
  - [ ] Schedule follow-up review
