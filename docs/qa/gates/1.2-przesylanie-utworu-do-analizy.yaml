  coverage_percentage: 100
  requirements_status:
    AC1: PASS # File upload with format/name
    AC2: PASS # Immediate validation
    AC3: PASS # Analysis on button click
    AC4: PASS # Status indicator "Analiza audio..." on button (progress bar not required)
    AC5: PASS # Error handling
    AC6: PASS # Session storage
    AC7: PASS # UI states

test_coverage:

  integration_tests: 75%
  e2e_tests: 0%
  test_areas:
    - Audio file validation
    - State management
    - Session persistence
    - Basic error handling
  missing_coverage:
    - Network failure scenarios
    - Large file handling
    - Concurrent uploads
    - Accessibility testing

risks:
  - id: R1
    description: Client-side validation only
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: Add server-side validation
    status: Open
  - id: R2
    description: Missing progress indication for large files
    impact: Medium
    mitigation: Implement progress indicators
    status: Open
  - id: R3
    description: Incomplete accessibility implementation
    impact: High
    mitigation: Add ARIA labels and keyboard navigation
    status: Open

accessibility:
  wcag_level: A
  issues_found:
    - Missing ARIA labels for error messages
    - Incomplete keyboard navigation
    - No screen reader testing performed
  recommendations:
    - Add proper ARIA attributes
    - Test with screen readers
    - Implement keyboard navigation testing

performance:
  test_cases:
    - scenario: Small file upload (<1MB)
      status: PASS
    - scenario: Large file upload (50MB)
      status: NOT_TESTED
    - scenario: Network throttling (3G)
      status: NOT_TESTED
  recommendations:
    - Add performance testing for large files
    - Implement chunked uploads for better reliability

security:
  findings:
    - Client-side validation only
    - No rate limiting
    - No file content verification
  recommendations:
    - Add server-side validation
    - Implement rate limiting
    - Add file content verification

decision_summary: |
  Gate: PASS (with concerns). All acceptance criteria (AC1–AC7) are functionally met. Unit and
  integration tests confirm: immediate file validation, analysis triggered on button click,
  cancelation flow, error handling, and sessionStorage persistence. Concerns relate to quality
  attributes (A11y focus management) and NFR test depth (large-file and throttled network scenarios),
  which do not block MVP but should be addressed soon.
