summary: 'The implementation is robust and addresses all initial concerns. The developer has successfully integrated a 30-second timeout for the LLM API call and implemented comprehensive checks for required environment variables, both at the service level and on application startup. The accompanying tests verify this new functionality. The story meets all quality criteria.'
