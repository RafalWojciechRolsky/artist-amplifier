# BMad-Core QA Gate v1.0
story: 2.1.integracja-music-ai-w-bff

# Gate: PASS
#
# Rationale:
# The implementation is robust, well-tested, and meets all acceptance criteria.
# The developer has successfully implemented a superior asynchronous architecture
# that mitigates the risk of blocking calls. The previous concerns regarding
# documentation (AC #4) and integration test coverage have been fully addressed
# in the latest version of the code.
#
# Key Findings:
# 1. All AC Met: All acceptance criteria are now fully met.
#    - AC #4 (Documentation) is verified; the `README.md` has been updated correctly.
# 2. Excellent Test Coverage: The newly added integration test (`integration-flow.test.ts`)
#    provides confidence in the complete asynchronous workflow (`/analyze` -> `/status`).
#    This resolves the primary concern from the previous review.
# 3. Positive Architectural Deviation: The implemented asynchronous polling architecture
#    is a significant improvement over the synchronous plan outlined in the original `Dev Notes`.
#    It is more resilient and scalable.
# 4. Minor Process Concern: The architectural deviation, while positive, was not
#    reflected in an updated story document prior to implementation. For future stories,
#    significant deviations should be discussed and documented to ensure alignment
#    across the team. This is a recommendation and does not block the story.
#
# Recommendation:
# The story is approved and ready for release.
