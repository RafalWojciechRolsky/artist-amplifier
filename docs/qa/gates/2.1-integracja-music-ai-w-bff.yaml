# Gate Review for Story 2.1: Integracja Music.ai w BFF

gate: CONCERNS
storyId: "2.1"
storySlug: "integracja-music-ai-w-bff"
reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect & Quality Advisor)
reviewDate: "2025-08-31"

summary: |
  The initial high-risk concern about a synchronous, blocking API call has been mitigated by an asynchronous implementation. However, the gate is marked as CONCERNS due to a significant deviation from the documented architecture, incomplete acceptance criteria, and insufficient test coverage.

concerns:
  - id: PROCESS-DEVIATION
    risk: High
    description: |
      The implemented architecture (asynchronous polling via `/api/audio/analyze` and `/api/audio/analyze/status`) is a major deviation from the synchronous `waitForJobCompletion` approach documented in the story's "Dev Notes".
    recommendation: |
      While the implemented solution is technically superior, the story's documentation must be updated to reflect the actual architecture to ensure future work is based on accurate information. This represents a process failure that needs to be addressed with the team.

  - id: INCOMPLETE-AC
    risk: Medium
    description: |
      Acceptance Criterion #4 ("The .env.example and README.md files are updated...") has not been fully met. The `README.md` file was not updated to document the new environment variables.
    recommendation: |
      The `README.md` file must be updated as per the acceptance criteria before the story can be considered complete.

  - id: INSUFFICIENT-TESTING
    risk: Medium
    description: |
      The testing requirements and implementation are limited to unit tests. The new asynchronous API flow, which involves multiple endpoints (`/analyze`, `/status`), is not covered by integration tests.
    recommendation: |
      Create integration tests to validate the entire end-to-end workflow:
      1. POST to `/analyze` with a file.
      2. Receive a 202 response with a `jobId`.
      3. Poll the `/status` endpoint with the `jobId`.
      4. Receive the final `AudioAnalysis` result.

recommendation: |
  The story should be returned to the development team to address the incomplete acceptance criterion and to add the required integration tests. The "Dev Notes" section of the story should be updated by the Product Owner or Architect to reflect the as-built architecture.
