# Epic Goal

To significantly improve the audio upload and analysis workflow by adding a song title input, refactoring the upload mechanism to support large files via Vercel Blob, implementing client-side validation, and providing clearer user feedback and error handling. This will make the core feature more robust, scalable, and user-friendly.
