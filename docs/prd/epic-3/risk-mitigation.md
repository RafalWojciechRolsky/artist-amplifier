# Risk Mitigation

- **Primary Risk:** The refactoring of the core upload functionality (Story 3.2) could break the main application workflow.
- **Mitigation:** The new implementation will be developed in parallel and tested thoroughly. Existing unit and integration tests will be updated, and new tests will be added to cover the Vercel Blob integration.
- **Rollback Plan:** The changes will be managed via a dedicated feature branch in Git, allowing for a quick revert if critical issues are found after merging.
